# Understand your code 
> ___cyle simpson___ said if you are using the code and you dont have a idea that what is the code doing then you people have to understan the code dont depend on code

>he gave a task to understand the code
```javascript
function plusPlus(a){
    var b = c = Number(a)
    d = c + 1
    return c
}
let d = "5"
plusPlus(d)
document.write(d)
```
> in this i maked a function in line no (1) and give a name (plusPlus)and inside the name i gave one parameter named (a)

> then in line no (2) i maked a a variable b and make him equal as (c) thats mean i change the name of variable  and then i give him a (Number) Method inside number i m calling (a) becouse a is main parameter of function

> then in line number (3) i m normal increment (d = c + 1) its mean the value of (d) assigns to (c) and then plus 1 

> then in line number (4) i (returned) (c) becouse the value of (d) is assings to (c)

> now in line number (5) i give a value to (d) d automaticaly assings to (c)

> then i call them 

## This is the right way to understand the code
