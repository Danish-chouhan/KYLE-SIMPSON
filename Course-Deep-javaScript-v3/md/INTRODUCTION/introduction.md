### postfix increment


**SYNTAX**
```javascript
var a = 10
a++
document.write(a) // 11

it will become 11 becouse of (a++) = a = a + 1
```
> this will be increment

> **deffination of postfix**  => *This will comes after the value (a++) it will returns the value before incrementing*

## preFix Increment

**SYNTAX**


```javascript
var a = 10
++a
document.write(a) // 11

it will become 11 becouse of (++a) = 1 + a = a
```
> this will be increment

> **deffination of prefix**  => *This will comes before the value (++a) it will returns the value after incrementing*

# There are one more type of increment

## NORMAL-INCREMENT

**Syntax**

> i telling you with a number inside string

```javascript
var a = "10"
a = a + 1
document.write(a) // 101

// this method is not useful in string form becouse this will not increase the number this will concat the values
```
> in this we can only use of (PostFix) and (PreFix) Methods

## The End
